Git Workflow Experiments
========================

This is a small project to explore the git histories that emerge when you use
particular Git Workflows.

To install dependencies:
    $ sudo apt-get install python-networkx

To run:
    $ python experiment.py

The program will print out the relevant content for a Confluence page.

It will also create a GraphML file:
    all.graphml

This contains all of the workflows, rendered in the 'graphml' format which is
understood by the interactive graphing tool 'yEd'.

Unfortunately 'yEd' won't render it very well to start with, you need to setup
a mapping for the node properties, instructions are here:

You should map 'label' and 'color' (uses the Solarized scheme)
